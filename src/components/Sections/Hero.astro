  <Title>About</Title>
  <p>
    My name is <mark class="bg-underline-color1">Martin Aranda</mark>,
    although my friends call me Ryo. I am an open source developer originally
    from
    <mark class="bg-underline-color2">Rancagua, Chile</mark>, with a
    strong focus on <mark class="bg-underline-color3"
      >web design and data management</mark
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started my journey as a programmer at the age of 10, using my mobile phone
    to create bots on Discord. Now, at <mark class="bg-underline-color4"
      >{age} years old</mark
    >, I am <mark class="bg-underline-color5">finishing school</mark> and I
    spend my free time programming to have fun with my friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of my personal goals is to be a reference and source of inspiration for
    fellow programmers. <mark class="bg-underline-color6"
      >I am dedicated to creating projects</mark
    > that not only advance open-source standards but also leave a lasting impact
    on the developer community, setting a new benchmark for innovation.
  </p>
  <p>
    With my first computer and two friends I founded <mark class="bg-underline-color7">Developer House</mark>
    , a Discord community dedicated to programming, where I managed and
    programmed the server with web and bot that had more than 600 active users.
    This project allowed me to meet new people who contributed to my personal
    development and as a programmer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I owe everything I have learned to friends and references on the Internet
    who have significantly influenced my technical training.
