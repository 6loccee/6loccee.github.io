				<p>
					My name is <Underline>Martin Aranda</Underline>, although my friends
					call me Ryo. I am an open source developer originally from
					<Underline>Rancagua, Chile</Underline>, with a strong focus on <Underline color="green">web design and data management</Underline
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started my journey as a programmer at the age of 10, using my mobile
					phone to create bots on Discord. Now, at <Underline
						>{age} years old</Underline
					>, I am <Underline>finishing school</Underline> and I spend my free time
					programming to have fun with my friends.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of my personal goals is to be a reference and source of
					inspiration for fellow programmers. <Underline>I am dedicated to creating
						projects</Underline> that not only advance open-source standards but also leave a
					lasting impact on the developer community, setting a new benchmark for
					innovation.
				</p>
				<p>
					With my first computer and two friends I founded <Underline
						>Developer House</Underline
					>, a Discord community dedicated to programming, where I serve as CEO
					and which had more than 500 active users. This project allowed me to
					meet new people who contributed to my personal development and as a
					programmer.
				</p>
				<p>
					I owe everything I have learned to friends and references on the
					Internet who have significantly influenced my technical training.
